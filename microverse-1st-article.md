I'm pressuming a very simple yet validated hypothesis:

> Attention is our most valuable form of capital nowadays.

This means that corporations, marketing and some other industries are developing technologies to catch our attention 24/7.

On the other side, there's a veil of wisdom surrounding programmers. It's not like that. It's just people who commited a lot in getting a goal and finding the motivation to keep going.

But doing so is, I won't lie to you, actually hard. As our attention span decreases, our motivation to do things that get us out of our confort zone is decreasing too.

I'll be honest with you. Before I started preparing for Microverse bootcamp, I didn't have enough motivation to trust myself I could achieve the goal of master web development.

One of those days, I remembered (Motivation hacker)[Mr Jekyll and Mr Hide.]

Now that everything has stopped, time is the best investment you can do and probably you are giving it to Facebook, Netflix, Youtube, Amazon Prime or some adult entretainment company. That time you are waisting can be useful to make you a valuable asset to rebuild our economies and get you in a better employment situation.

In my personal experience... Microverse is a great help and I'll explain you why with this recommendations to learn to code.

## Exercise both mind and body

Everything starts with what you eat and how you move. I have to confess I've struggled with some compulsive behaviour and issues dealing frustration. Most of us are like that, the span of attention a digital consumer has is really short. So it gets harder and harder to deal with anxiety, FOMO and depression.
I think medidation and exercise are the best options. It's important to realize that code is all about patience and analysis.

## Breathe first, deep later

I read an awesome article on Math for programmers 
Some great general resources

## Documentation is everything

There's an old saying when starting to code: *RTFM*.
It stands for *Read the f\* manual*.
Also, categorize the articles you liked the most. For example, my favorite articles for front-end are:

- For HTML I loved
- For CSS, one of my favorites was (this one)[https://designshack.net/articles/css/5-steps-to-drastically-improve-your-css-knowledge-in-24-hours/].

If you ever stuck by not knowing how to write some processes down, trust this sources:

- spreeder

## Play around

With this I literally mean play games. There are too many interactive games out there to help you get the most out of 

## Get involved

Programming has to do with solving problems. Find a problem that make you feel curious and dive into it. Is it about making web animations? Do you want to make an interactive dashboard to optimize your spendings? Just feel free to find things that you'd like to solve.

## Learn by chunks

For me, the most fundamental project to start web development is to deliver a GitHub pages site either with plain HTML or through Jekyll if you are planning to make a whole static web project. It takes no more than 2 hours and the fact you are achiving results pumps adrenaline and joy up.

Try to stick to small delivered projects. You can rely on clockify or Trello to keep track of your times. Motivation is the most important skill to have after a couple of months that progress speed starts to slow down.

## Learn with others

I want you to repeat this with me:

YOU

ARE

NOT

ALONE

Nowadays, specially due to Coronavirus terrible pandemic, a lot of people is getting more and more in videoconference. Are you worried about how to make it after the economic crisis? Learn something useful like Data Science basics or even code, create communities of self-learners. It would be amazing if, instead of play one of those MMOGs for just half a year, by spending your time learning with a partner for the next months you could accelerate your code learning process.

So that's what Microverse *pair programming* methodology goes about. And it can get you in a **60,000 USD** per year job.

## Get familiar with version control

There are a couple of things that make everything much easier.
One is Git control version and the other one is VSCode.

## Take your time (but not too long to get bored)

In Microverse, we apply Mastery Learning, which is 

## Apply deep learning

Microverse has brought me into a nice combination of education methodologies. Apart from *Mastery Learning*, they encourage us to work through *Deep Learning* as well.

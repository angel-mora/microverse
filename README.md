Step 5: If you haven’t already, create accounts on freeCodeCamp, Hacker Noon, and Medium. Previously, you could submit articles for publication on freeCodeCamp and Hacker Noon directly through Medium, but as of 2019, both fCC and HN have moved articles away from Medium. Therefore, you will need to create accounts at each individual site in order to submit your content to that site. 

Step 1: To help guide and focus your writing, write the following sentence at the top of your article, filling in the blanks: My post will help [TARGET AUDIENCE] to solve [INSERT PROBLEM] by teaching them [INSERT SOLUTION]. Make sure to delete this before you submit your articles to any publications, of course!

## Introduction: 

Talk about my own experience with programming motivation.

## Share my core idea:

It’s important for all developers to be good at HTML/CSS, but they don’t necessarily have to be experts.

## Reverse a string
https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-reverse-a-string-in-JavaScript

Some arrays methods that are available to JavaScript developers include: .join(), .slice(), .splice(), .shift(), .unshift(), and .concat() amongst many others. Using these built-in methods make it easier to do some common tasks when working with arrays. 

## Arrays exercises to practice
Looking for more ways to practice? Consider trying these:

- Use the .length property to find the last element of an array.
- Use the other methods in MDN documentation not mentioned in the lesson.
- Take all the elements in an array and make a string.
- Find the return value of calling .push() on an array.
- Nest an array within an array.
- Access an element in the nested array.

## Loop function basic structure

```
for (let i = 0; i < bobsFollowers.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < tinasFollowers.length; j++) {
    if ( bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j] ) {
      (mutualFollowers.push(tinasFollowers [j] ))
     }
  }
} console.log(mutualFollowers) ;
```

### Difference for, while, do-while
For stores variable inside function
While declares variable first and then it runs function
In situations when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, while loops are the best choice.
Unlike the while loop, *do...while* will run at least once whether or not the condition evaluates to true.
